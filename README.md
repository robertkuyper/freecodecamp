# freeCodeCamp
## Purpose
The purpose of this repository is to keep all of the projects I do on
freeCodeCamp together in a single place. I will be completeing each available
certification and collecting the code here.

## Disclaimer
Much of the code in freeCodeCamp is fed to the learner piece by piece. For this
reason, I am splitting the code into two sub folders in courses that need it.
One folder, called Practice Projects, will contain the code that is part of the
step by step instruction provided by the site. The other folder, called
Certification Projects, will contain the code that I wrote to meet the
certification requirements. This should provide a reasonable distinction between
other peoples' code and my own.

## Courses
### Responsive Web Design
[Certification](https://freecodecamp.org/certification/robertjkuyper/responsive-web-design)

This course teaches the basics of HTML and CSS with some instruction on creating
responsive sites through media queries. Dynamically changing the CSS allows for
better usability on a broad range of devices.

From my experience with this class, I think it is a decent primer, but it would
take a lot of study or experience to make a site that worked well on all
platforms. It seems pretty common to target only a few platforms when developing
based on the userbase the tool is intended for.
