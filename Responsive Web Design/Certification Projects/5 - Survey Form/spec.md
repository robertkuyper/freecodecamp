# Survey Form Full Solution
This project is based on https://survey-form.freecodecamp.rocks/
There are two screenshots at different resolutions located in the reference
sub-folder. To produce this solution, I started with the code I wrote as the
minimum answer, located in the minimum folder, and expanded it to appear more
like the example site. I did not try to copy it pixle perfect, though that may
be a later project if I still want more practice, and instead opted for a site
inspired by the example and still meeting the requirements.
